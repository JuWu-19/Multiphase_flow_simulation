## Multiphase Flow Simulation for Powder Chamber
The working process of the airflow chamber for air-powder mixture can be regarded as the fluidization
process, in which the granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluidlike state. This process occurs when a fluid is passed up through the granular material, in our case the high-speed air is injected into the chamber and mixed with the powder. The powder particles
are forced by particle-particle mutual interaction, drag force induced by relative velocity with the
air, and gravity. \

### Digitize the products/prototypes
* Avoid/decrease the physical tests
* Better understand the intrinsic behaviors insides the chamber and its interaction with the external
* Facilitate prototype development and validation

### Capture pivotal features
We can observe that both of the experimental and simulation data share the same ratio (near tenfold)
of peak and stable mass flow rate shown as: \

Thus this pivotal physical dynamics of the initial phase can be captured by our digitalization model and multiphase flow simulation.
